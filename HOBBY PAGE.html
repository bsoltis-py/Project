    <h1><b>What is Raspberry Pi?</b></h1>
    <p>Raspberry Pi is a tiny modular computer that can fit in the size of your palm! Only costing $35, the RaspberryPi is a perfect way to learn coding, robotics, and much more in the vast world of technology. The Raspberry Pi became very popular because of its low cost and high utility. How the RaspberryPi got its name is very relevant to the technology trends of the time. It is called Raspberry because of the many technology companies being named after fruit at the time, like Apple and Blackberry. 
        In addition, it is called "Pi" because it meant to run on the coding language "Python".

    <p>It can be programmed for just about anything you can think of! If you wanted to program the Raspberry Pi to be a surveillance system or monitor the room temperature, it can do that! The Raspberry Pi can be used in conjunction with cameras, sensors, motors, and any compatible device. It was designed to be used by those with little coding experience and even advanced coders! 
        RapberryPi projects can solve small or large issues, such as home security or even just telling the time on a display screen. With so many uses, its no wonder that RaspberryPi is so popular among kids learning to code and advanced users too!</p>

<h1><b>Uses and Applications</b></h1>
<p>The Raspberry Pi can be used for limitless projects! If you can code it, the Raspberry Pi can be used with a multitude of external hardware devices. Temperature sensors, led display screens, and so many different devices can be compatible with the RaspberryPi. This leads to a plethora different projects which will increase the users coding and technology skills.</p>

<h1><b>Rising Popularity and Prices</b></h1>
<p>Due to increased demand for Raspberry Pi, The prices for individual units has increased subsantially. According to the Raspberry Pi CEO, Eben Upton, in an an interview, Eben says “We sold 7 million Raspberry Pis in 2020, which was a strange year but obviously an unconstrained year. Last year we were constrained by chip supply — sold 7 million again, in an environment where I’d expect to sell 8 or 9, maybe 9 or 10. This year we’ll be down. We’ll be fewer than 7 million,” he said on the Cambridge Tech Podcast in 2022.</p>
